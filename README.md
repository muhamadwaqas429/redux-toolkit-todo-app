# 📝 Redux Toolkit Todo App

This is a simple and clean Todo app I built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.  
I created this project to understand how global state management actually works — how actions, reducers, and slices connect together to handle data in a React app.

---

## 🚀 What the App Does

It’s a basic CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks:
- ✨ Add new todos  
- 📝 Edit existing todos  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- 💾 All data stays in global state using Redux Toolkit

The goal wasn’t to build a big app, but to **strengthen my Redux fundamentals**.

## 💡 What I Learned

While making this, I finally understood:
- The difference between **local state (useState)** and **global state (Redux)**  
- How `useSelector` gets data from the store  
- How `useDispatch` triggers actions  
- How reducers update state in an immutable way  
- The importance of organizing logic in slices for scalability

This project helped me become more confident with Redux Toolkit and React hooks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – for building UI  
- **Redux Toolkit** – for state management  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, clean styling

## 🧩 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redux-toolkit-todo-app.git
2. Move into the folder
3. cd redux-toolkit-todo-app
4. Install dependencies
5. npm install
6. Start the app
7. npm run dev
This was one of the first apps that really helped me understand the flow of data in React.
It might look simple, but for me it was a turning point — I learned how to make things dynamic, manage updates, and handle global state properly.
